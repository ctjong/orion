## Condition Syntax

The condition can be written in this format "{fieldName}{comparison-operator}{fieldValue}". Multiple conditions can also be joined to create a compound condition string "{condition1}{logical-operator}{condition2}".

Operators:
- **Comparison operators**: "&sim;", "<>", "<=", ">=", "<", ">", "=".
    The "&sim;" operator can be used for string/text fields, to match strings with a certain substring in it. The other operators can be used for int/float/timestamp fields.
- **Logical operators**: "&" (and), "\|" (or)

**Note:** if you want to include the condition string in a URL, it will have to be URL-encoded. This can be done using the "encodeURIComponent()" method in Javascript, or similar method in other languages.
